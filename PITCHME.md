# Problem
#### Static analysis tools exist to detect programming errors without running the code, but software developers rarely use them to check their work...

+++
# Problem

#### Researchers found that __tool output__ is one of the main reasons software engineers don't use static analysis tools.

# PackHacks Project

* Analyze code with the static analysis tool (http://errorprone.info/)[Error Prone]
* Parse the output to collect errors found by the tool
* Randomly generate memes to present errors to developers
* Generate an html file with errors, memes, and links to reported bugs
